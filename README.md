## 🛠 Technologies
* **Kotlin**: The core programming language used for developing the application.
* **Java 21 SDK**: The application runs with Java 21 for enhanced performance and new features.
* **Spring Boot 3**: Framework for building the application quickly and efficiently with embedded server support.
* **Gradle**: Build automation tool used for managing dependencies and running tasks.
* **MySQL**: Database for storing the application data (doctors, patients, appointments).
* **JPA/Hibernate**: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for managing data persistence between Java objects and MySQL.
* **Flyway**: Database migration tool for managing version-controlled schema changes.
* **Validation**: Bean validation for input validation in various parts of the application.
* **Spring Security & JWT Token**: Provides security features including authentication and authorization with JWT tokens.
* **SpringDoc**: Automatically generates API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger) from your Spring controllers.
* **JUnit 5**: Framework for unit testing the application.
* **MockMvc**: For testing the controllers in isolation.

## 📦 Installation Guide
### 🖥️ Prerequisites
* **JDK 21** or later
* **Gradle** 
* **MySQL**: Ensure you have MySQL installed and running, or you can use a cloud-based MySQL service.

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash 
   git clone https://github.com/josesreyesdev/med-api.git
   cd med-api
    ```
2. **Configure the MySQL Database**
   
    Make sure your MySQL server is running. You can create a new database with the following commands:
    ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE med_api;
   ```
3. **Set up application properties**

   In the `src/main/resources/application.properties` (or `application.yml`), configure your database connection. Modify the following:
    ``` properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/med_api
   spring.datasource.username=your_db_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_db_password
   spring.flyway.enabled=true
   ```
4. **Build and run the application**
    ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```
   Alternatively, you can build the JAR file and run it:
    ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   java -jar build/libs/med-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```
   The application should now be running at `http://localhost:8080/api/`.
5. **Access API Documentation**

   Once the application is running, you can access the automatically generated API documentation via Swagger UI at:
    ```bash
   http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/
   ```
   This will provide you with an interactive interface to test the API endpoints.

## 🔐 Security
The API is secured using Spring Security with JWT tokens for authentication. You will need to log in to receive a token, which must be included in the Authorization header of requests.
#### Authentication Example
To authenticate, send a `POST` request to `/api/auth` with the following payload:
```json
{
  "email": "your_email@example.com",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```
On success, you will receive a JWT token that you can use for subsequent requests.
```json
{
  "accessToken": "your_jwt_token_here"
}
```
